``` r
## do i have to add col_types for transit_data or transit_data_clean?

transit_data_clean = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = tolower(entry),
    entry = recode(entry, "yes" = 1, "no" = 0))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

### Explanation

The variables contained in this new clean data file are line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served (1 through 11), entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. The first thing I did was create a new dataset called "transit\_data\_clean" to distinguish it from the raw dataset. Then, I read in the raw dataset and input read\_csv since it was a csv file using a relative path to make sure that I am able to pull in that data set if shared with others. Then, I used the janitor package to clean up the variable names to change the names to snake and lowercase. After, I selected only the variables that were requested by including all the columns from line to vending, then adding ADA compliance to the end. I then made all the rows within the entry variable lowercase by using tolower before recoding all the yes to equal 1 and no's to equal 0. The data is not yet tidy since there are multiple variable
